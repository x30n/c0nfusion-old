      <description>Around the year 2000, I got my first always on (ADSL) internet connection at home. I was working as a sysadmin and programmer at the time for the high school I&amp;rsquo;d just graduated from (we actually provided technology services and operated a full fledged ISP for a number of other schools across California).
Anyway, once I had stable internet access (with a static IP!) at home, I of course had to stake my claim on the internet.</description>
